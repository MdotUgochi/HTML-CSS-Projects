<h2>A Short Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Mercy Anih. I am a software engineering student at Altschool Africa with <em>Student ID: <strong>ALT/SOE/024/5525</strong></em>. <br>
            I am a Nigerian from the South Eastern part of the country. I studied English language and literature in the University of Ibadan so I kind of enjoy art in form of music, movies, and meaningful conversations. However, I love language both as an art and a science. <br>
            I love discussions around language and how it has shaped our world. <em>I think that explains my interest in Natural Language Processing as a techie</em>.

<h2>My Altschool Adventure</h2>   
    <p>
        How did I get hereü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è? Sit back and relax as I take you on a ride. <br>
        <br>
        I remember how that a major pain point that I had back in school was listening to my sociolinguistics lecturer tell us that with more people embracing and giving precedence to European languages over our native languages, most of our languages will soon fizzle out. I knew that we have to find a way to fix it. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a way that our culture is embedded in our language. Do you want to know the way of life, customs, and traditions of a people? Pay attention to their language. The fabrics of our society are woven into our native languages and once any of our local languages dies, a fragment of our being dies and very soon, we will have nothing that is peculiarly ours to hand over to the generation after us.
        <br>
        <br>
            I started reading extensively on this phenomenon and how it can be helped. Sincerely, no language should fizzle out. if it's speakers all die, resources on the language should be gathered to digitalize it. Thanks to technology, we can now digitalize languages. All of these led me to Natural Language Processing.
        <br>
        <br>
            I am in Altschool because I want to contribute to what NLP experts are doing by building systems for low resource African languages. I look forward to working with data engineers to build bots that we can engage with in all of our native Nigerian dialects.
