<h2>Resources for Self-help</h2>
<p>As a software engineering student from a non-STEM background, I constantly push myself to go the extra mile with learning. Asides from the resources and class notes that my school makes available, I constantly look to other sources of knowledge on the subject matter.</p>
<p>I want to introduce you to fre code camp. The resources provided by <a href="https://github.com/gitdagray">Dave Gray</a> has helped me a lot in learning CSS and HTML.</p>
<p>See attached for full tutorials.</p>
